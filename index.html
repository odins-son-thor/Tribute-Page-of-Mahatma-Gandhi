            <p class="bold intro-text">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was the leader of the Indian independence
                movement against British rule. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence
                and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā applied to
                him first in 1914 in South Africa is now used worldwide. In India, he is also called Bapu (Gujarati:
                endearment for "father") and Gandhiji. He is unofficially called the Father of the Nation.</p>
